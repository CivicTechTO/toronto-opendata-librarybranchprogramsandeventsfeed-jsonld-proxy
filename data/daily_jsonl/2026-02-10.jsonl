Transcending the tactile sensations felt at the fingertips, shokkan is the combination of memories, language, and other senses like sight and sound. \n\nThis exhibition showcases over 100 objects. From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the “imagined touch” of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.", "url": "https://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/exhibitions/shokkan-japanese-art-through-the-sense-of-touch-title-tbc?utm_source=cityoftoronto&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=shokkan&utm_content=tourism", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/bowl_page-0001_1z3whNxr51t6iJ7pV9T7JQ.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Royal Ontario Museum", "email": "info@rom.on.ca", "telephone": "4165868000"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "url": "https://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/exhibitions/shokkan-japanese-art-through-the-sense-of-touch-title-tbc?utm_source=cityoftoronto&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=shokkan&utm_content=tourism"}}
