He is a former member of Nu Guinea, Nuova Napoli Band and is involved and engaged in the Italian scene of radical improvisation. The compositions are inspired by the idea of natural biodiversity as an expression of contamination, coexistence and balance. Multiculturalism becomes coexistence. Suggestive saxophone textures intertwine on a solid rhythmic equilibrium and move naturally along an imaginary line highlighting the ancestral connection between Africa and the Mediterranean Sea.",

We can think of no better way to forge those bonds than through music.  The shared experience of using that music to help others heightens the strength of those bonds and reinforces the resolve in our young performers that they can make a difference. Because we seek out young musicians of truly exceptional talent, who are often already committed to careers in music, we expect that more than a few future stars will have grown up in our community — and that the philanthropic instinct we help to nurture now will benefit the world later.",

Transcending the tactile sensations felt at the fingertips, shokkan is the combination of memories, language, and other senses like sight and sound. \n\nThis exhibition showcases over 100 objects. From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the “imagined touch” of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",
